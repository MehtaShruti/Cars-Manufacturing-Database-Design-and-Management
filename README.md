Cars Manufacturing Database Design and Management : CarCoopers 

Problem Statement

In this project, I have implemented Relational database of vehicle manufacturing and customization. There are various locations around the world where the manufacturing enterprises are located along with their pick up centers also called as Showrooms.
There are multiple Vehicles Enterprises such as Tesla, Volkswagon that place orders for their vehicles manufacturing to Vehicle Company and then orders are manufactured.
Customers are responsible for buying the products. Online customers customize the vehicles online using User Account and then place orders Online. Customer can pick up the orders at the showroom. Showroom customers can buy products available at the store.
Vehicle company has list of departments responsible for manufacturing the vehicles. The customized vehicle order is first sent to the design department, once the design is complete then to the manufacturing and then back to the showroom for the customer pickup. Also, the showroom contains a list of cars by various car companies out for sale which can be bought by the customer as well.
The users of this database will be the customers(online and store), vehicle car companies employees, showroom staff, vehicles enterprise staff.
